        <p>
          Commissioned by Aurora University, this GPA calculator was built over
          the course of several months. Regular meetings were held during this time,
          which started with University staff laying out what they wanted in this tool.
          Subsuqent meetings were held to display and track progress, propose and discuss
          potential changes, and chart how much time was left on the project.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          As for the actual functionality, Javascript handles all of the calculations,
          along with other functions. A simple HTML table is displayed with inputs for
          course name, grade, and credit hours. A Javascript function automatically appends
          four additional rows on load, as the typical course load is four, but additional rows
          can be added or deleted, which uses another Javascript function.  Also, all inputs in
          the table and in other forms can be reset using the reset button located below the table.
        </p>

        <p>
          The grade and credit hour inputs are populated dropdowns, as the University only
          uses certain grade and credit hour values. Once a user has selected both a grade
          and credit hour value, the quality points and term GPA and credits are calculated
          and dynamically displayed in their applicable spots. If they wish to calculate their
          cumulative GPA with their current term included, there is a toggle button that displays
          the inputs for that. These inputs are parsed only if the value is a number, so entering
          anything else prevents the calculation from using something that would cause an error.
        </p>

          If they wish to calculate their cumulative GPA with their current term included, there
          is a toggle button that displays the inputs for that. These inputs are parsed only if
          the value is a number, so entering anything else prevents the calculation from using a
          value that would cause an error.  Again, the output is dynamically calculated when
          a new value has been entered

        </div>

        <p>
          Lastly, there is a projection calculation.  This is used if the student has a specific GPA
          they would like to achieve and a certain amount of credit hours remaining.  The grade value
          of their target GPA is then calculated and then compared to their actual GPA, and then
          the GPA they would need to maintain is dispalyed.  If it is not possible, such as needing
          a GPA of 10, a message displays that the target GPA cannot be achieved.
